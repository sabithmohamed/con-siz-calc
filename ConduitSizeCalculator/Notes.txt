Pending tasks:
MarkText => Currently, Setting Marktext can be done by both it's dedicated set button, or the overall set button at the bottom. NEED TO REMOVE THE DEDICATED BUTTON. Currently, the overall set
button is disabled unless a change occurs in the conduit parameters. Need to find a way to enable it when the mark parameter changes too.

Type/Instance params => Able to set the values for both Intances and Type parameters. However, when the window loads, the type parameters are not loaded, only instance parameters are loaded. 
Find a way to load the values of type parameters also.
